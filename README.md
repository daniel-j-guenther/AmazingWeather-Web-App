# Udacity P3: Weather-Journal App

## Overview

The goal of this project is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build and develop responsive websites and applications by building an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and User Data to dynamically update the UI.

## Instructions

- Setup a Node environment with Express.
- Setup a server.js file with GET and POST routes.
- Use the Fetch API to create developer credentials for a Web API.
- Access GET routes on server-side, from a functions called on client-side.
- Chain Promises together to update the User Interface dynamically.

## Experiences

In order to speed up the development time I staged this project into chunks- I did all the HTML and CSS first,then setup the node and express environment with all dependancies and middleware. This took one sitting whereby I was able to return the following day and focus exclusively on the Asynchronous Javascript (Promises / Fetch API).

I figured out the API request in a surprisingly short amount of time, which co-insidently I had assumed would be the more difficult part. The more difficult part for me turned out to be the GET/POST routes. At first I understood them back to front. The second mistake I made was debbuging two main functions at once - I was trying to configure the POST request and update the UI at once and lost a lot of time juggling both. In doing so I learned the value of chopping down on functions when debugging.
